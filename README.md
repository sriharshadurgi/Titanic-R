# Titanic-R
Titanic passenger survival rate using R

Worked on writing an R program which extracts and deals with dataset containing information of passengers on Titanic.
Utilized test data and train data, the former to see how well our Machine learning models perform and the later to build several 
such machine learning models.

combined datasets and converted them to factors to work on using R.

Called on librries for plotting graphs on the analyzed data.
Created several tables and factors containing data on the basis of passenger class, gender, age and cabins they were travelling in.
Plotted efficient graphs showing survivability based on all the above factors.

The code gives an overall information on the survival rate of Titanic passengers taking into consideration all the factors necessary and 
got successful outcomes for the efficient ML models used.
